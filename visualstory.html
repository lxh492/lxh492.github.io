          <h3>A Short Documentary: The Little Coffee</h3>

          <p class="videocontent">Americans consume 400 million cups of coffee per day, and about 83% adults drink coffee. I believe coffee is not only a kind of drink that can refresh people, coffee means something for people. Some people make lives
            on coffee business; some people are coffee lovers that cannot live without coffee; some people start their relationships because of coffee; some people have tight bond with coffee from generations to generations. In Miami,
            coffee is one of the most signature products that combines different people and different cultures.

            The decoration is very warm and homey, stuffs are so friendly.
            Thanks for Carlos to share his own coffee story with me and show me the beautiful process behind a cup of  fresh cuban coffee.
            Amazing latte art, and it is the most artistic cuban coffee I have ever had.
